This repository documents my ongoing journey into quantitative finance.
Each day I explore a new concept, build code, analyze real data, and publish a short research note or mini-paper.

The goal is to build deep intuition in:
1. time-series analysis
2. return distributions
3. volatility dynamics
4. factor research
5. replication of academic papers
6. building real quant workflows
